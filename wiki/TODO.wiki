  * Select folder
  * Start:
    * Traverse subfolders
    * Check file sizes
    * Gather path for files with one size in some map
    * Set progress bar maximum to selected files number
    * For each file:
      * Calculate MD5 (http://stackoverflow.com/questions/10520048/calculate-md5-checksum-for-a-file)
      * Increase ProgressBar value
    * Remove files with different sums from map
    * _Optional._ The same sum is 99.9% of similarity, but there's a chance of different files with the same checksum. But we can always perform byte comparison..
    * Populate TreeView (or other) control with results
    * _Optional._ Fire some MessageBox
  * Cancel:
    * Stop traversing and calculating
  * Click on TreeView item with file name:
    * Subitems are opened with pathes of duplicated file
    * _Optional._ Perform some actions with selected file
